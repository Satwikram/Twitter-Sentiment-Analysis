At Google, on our personal page, we're asked to put a 3-word mission that describes what we do.

Here's mine:

Make AI Easy

What's yours?

It's also a nice hashtag #MakeAIEasy

More companies should tell employees it's fine if your kids  show up on Zoom when you're working from home.
This isn't a sign of someone being unprofessional. This is a sign  that you're a human being.

Thank you for making everything great again Sir.
We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive.
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive.
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky.
MAGA machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry!
MAGA Horse racing AMEN
